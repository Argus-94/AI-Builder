Android requires enabling it manually in system Accessibility settings.

AI Builder cannot silently grant it. Android Settings may require you to enable Apps → AI Builder → Permissions → Additional permissions → RUN_COMMAND manually. The bridge is not activated until the native permission check confirms the grant.", riskLevel: "medium", isRequired: false, openSettingsAction: "app-details" },

It is not needed at first launch. Android may require Apps → Special app access → Install unknown apps → AI Builder. The installer checks PackageManager.canRequestPackageInstalls() before opening the system installer; opening Settings alone does not grant it.", riskLevel: "medium", isRequired: false, openSettingsAction: "unknown-sources-settings" },
